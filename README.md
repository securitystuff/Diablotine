Project to come

The main files of Diablotine 2.0 are going to be available at a later date. Meanwhile, all other files are going to be developped and shared on this repository. Sources whose some files are based on will be cited here as well when the project comes to an end.

Edited to add (Aug 5th 2020): A demo version of Diablotine (POC) is available in the Gist section. Since Diablotine 2.0 still works on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, its release is postponed until the end of the support of this Ubuntu version.
